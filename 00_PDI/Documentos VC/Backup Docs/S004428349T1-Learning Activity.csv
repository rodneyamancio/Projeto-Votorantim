Learn to address interpersonal and emotional issues as well as technical matters. a) Get to know each customer as a person. Take advantage of every opportunity to establish connections with individuals in the audience.

Maybe what we could do is just cover the first few steps today, then I can come back next week to finish up.c) Recognize and react to negative emotions.
